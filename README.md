# CRUD_APP
Implemented methods for adding, completing, and removing tasks within the TaskListScreen widget, including Firebase database operations.
Users can create list and add taks. Once a task is added they can delete it with the del button or my marking as completed(check mark it it deletes). 
This app uses Firebase auth to let users make accounts and login once signed up.
